 Some people believe that climate change is not real because they think that the earth has been changing since its creation and climate change is also associated as a change that the Earth can endure. Moreover, another misconception about climate change is that plants need Carbon dioxide to live so increase in carbon dioxide level is not a problem. Lastly, some people believe that climate change is not real as the weather still gets cold.  array.

    Firstly, I would explain the facts that prove that climate change is real making sure that I do not give too much information to process and just provide information that relates to climate change. Furthermore, I would show them patterns in increase in CO2 emission and the increase of global temperature level due to the increase in emissions and visually represent in graphs so that it is easy for them to interpret the data I am trying to represent. There are multiple factors that prove that Climate change is real so I would try to tie all these factors together to create a story, and explain it in a manner that is easy to understand by a layman.
